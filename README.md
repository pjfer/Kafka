# Pratical Assignment I

The project is about an harvest in an agricultural farm.

There are two main entities: the Control Center (CC) and the Farm Infrastructure (FI). The CC is responsible for supervising the harvest. The FI is the
infrastructure for the agricultural harvest.

The CC and the FI are implemented as two different processes and the communication between them is through sockets.
